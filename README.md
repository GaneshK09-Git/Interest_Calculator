Compound Interest Calculator

This is a simple command-line Python program that calculates the compound interest earned on a principal amount over time at a given annual interest rate.


How It Works:

Prompts the user for: Principal amount, Annual interest rate (as a percentage), Time (in years)

Validates the inputs to ensure none of them are negative.

Applies the compound interest formula:

𝐴 = 𝑃 ×(1+𝑟/100)𝑡



Where:

P = Principal amount

r = Annual interest rate

t = Time (in years)

A = Final amount after interest


Features:

1. Input validation for non-negative values

2. Accurate compound interest calculation using the pow() function

3. Clean, formatted output showing the final balance


Example:

Enter the principle amount: 1000

Enter the interest rate: 5

Enter the time: 3

Balance after 3 year/s: $1157.63
